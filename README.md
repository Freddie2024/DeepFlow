# DeepFlow

Developed as the capstone project for my Web Development Bootcamp at **SPICED Academy**, this app was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About
**DeepFlow** serves as a streamlined task manager, helping you focus on your most important daily goals. Inspired by the **1-2-3 List** method, it encourages you to plan your day by prioritizing **1 major task**, **2 medium tasks**, and **3 small tasks**.

### Key Features:
- **Daily and Tomorrow Lists**: 
  - Organize your day with compact, focused to-do lists limited to six tasks.
  - Add details like title, optional description, due date, and estimated duration:
    - 1 major tasks: 3 hours
    - 2 medium tasks: 1 hour
    - 3 small tasks: 20 minutes
- **Long-Term Task Management**: 
  - Keep track of additional tasks and ideas on dedicated lists:
    - **Later Date**: For tasks with a specific due date.
    - **Someday**: For tasks without a defined timeline.
- **Comprehensive Overview**:
  - View and manage all tasks in a centralized list.
  - Use filtering and sorting tools to stay organized.
- **Seamless Task Interaction**:
  - Edit task details whenever necessary.
  - Open detailed task views for in-depth information.
  - Mark tasks as completed (displayed in a separate section below active tasks).
  - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

With its intuitive design and practical features, TaskFlow helps you prioritize effectively and stay on top of your to-dos with confidence.
